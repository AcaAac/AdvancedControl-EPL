## Lab 1: MagLev Control

### Description

This lab focuses on controlling a Magnetic Levitation (MagLev) system using P, PI, PID, and IFT PID controllers. The lab folder contains the problem sheet, the data taken from the lab computers and a robust control approach.

### Installation

To set up the environment for Lab 1, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AcaAac/AdvancedControl-EPL.git

# Navigate to the MagLev lab directory
cd AdvancedControl-EPL/Lab1
```

### Report
```bash

# Main report resides at
cd AdvancedControl-EPL/Lab1/LINMA2671_labo_MAGLEV-VF.pdf
```

## Lab 2: Pendubot Control

### Description

This lab focuses on controlling a Pendubot using both linear and nonlinear controllers. The lab folder contains the problem sheet, the submitted code, and the comprehensive report.

### Installation

To set up the environment for Lab 1, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AcaAac/AdvancedControl-EPL.git

# Navigate to the MagLev lab directory
cd AdvancedControl-EPL/Lab2
```

### Usage

Code is split into National Instruments section, which was ran via the lab computers for the real system (https://www.ni.com/en.html) and the simulated MATLAB code at
```bash
cd AdvancedControl-EPL/Lab2/Pendubot_Simulator
```
Through this code you can run the simulated controllers via simulink.

### Report
```bash

# Main report resides at
cd AdvancedControl-EPL/Lab2/LINMA2671_labo_PENDUBOT-4.pdf
```
